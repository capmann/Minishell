# ft_minishell
Reproduce a basic shell like bash (C)

Description:

Minishell is a compact and efficient shell program, akin to a miniature version of Bash. The project's main goal is to delve into the inner workings of a command-line interface and to understand the processes behind shell operations in Unix-like systems. By recreating a functional environment where command execution is possible, Minishell serves as a testament to both system programming skills and a deep understanding of operating system principles. By engaging with system-level programming, Minishell has strengthened my problem-solving skills and my ability to translate complex system concepts into a functional and user-friendly program.


Features:

    Command line input and basic command processing
    Built-in commands implementation (e.g., cd, echo, exit)
    Environment variables management
    Signal handling (e.g., Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, Ctrl-\)
    Execution of binaries with arguments and error handling
    Expansion of environment variables and command substitution
    Piping and redirection to handle input/output flow

Challenges:

    Implementing a robust parser and lexer to handle user input
    Managing process creation and execution securely and efficiently
    Ensuring accurate signal handling for a seamless user experience

Learning Outcomes:

    Gained in-depth knowledge of system calls and process management
    Advanced understanding of memory management and security considerations in system programming
    Enhanced proficiency in the C programming language and Unix system programming
